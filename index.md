# CPSC 330 HW 5 Analysis

In CPSC 330 HW5 we'll be exploring a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data) of New York City Airbnb listings from 2019. As usual, you'll need to start by downloading the dataset. In this assignment we'll try to predict `reviews_per_month`, as a proxy for the popularity of the listing. Airbnb could use this sort of model to predict how popular future listings might be before they are posted, perhaps to help guide hosts create more appealing listings. In reality they might instead use something like vacancy rate or average rating as their target, but we do not have that available here.


#Your post must include the following elements (not necessarily in this order):

- Description of the problem/decision.
- Description of the dataset (the raw data and/or some EDA).
- Description of the model.
- Description your results, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Make sure to refer to the original problem/decision.
- A section on caveats, describing at least 3 reasons why your results might be incorrect, misleading, overconfident, or otherwise problematic. Make reference to your specific dataset, model, approach, etc. To check that your reasons are specific enough, make sure they would not make sense, if left unchanged, to most students' submissions; for example, do not just say "overfitting" without explaining why you might be worried about overfitting in your specific case.
- At least 3 visualizations. These visualizations must be embedded/interwoven into the text, not pasted at the end. The text must refer directly to each visualization. For example "as shown below" or "the figure demonstrates" or "take a look at Figure 1", etc. It is **not** sufficient to put a visualization in without referring to it directly.

A reasonable length for your entire post would be **800 words**. The maximum allowed is **1000 words**.
